  theme.js — PlantHub's colours and fonts, shared by every page.

  Each page loads Tailwind from its CDN and then this file, which hands
  Tailwind the palette below. One file, so every page matches.

/*
  PlantHub's colours, with one rule behind them:

    GREEN MEANS FRESH. Nothing else.

  Green ("signal") is spent only where the page is telling you how recently
  a nursery confirmed a listing. Everything else is built from ink (a
  near-black green), cream, sand and clay. If green were also the buttons,
  the links and the tags, it would stop meaning anything, and freshness is
  the one thing this site has that the competition doesn't.
